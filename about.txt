## Technical Implementation Methods

### 1. Process Monitoring and Control

- **Process Table Scanning**: Periodic and event-driven scans of the /proc filesystem
- **Lineage Tracking**: Maintains process creation chains and validates parent-child relationships
- **Memory Mapping Analysis**: Examines /proc/[pid]/maps for unauthorized memory regions
- **File Descriptor Auditing**: Monitors open file descriptors for suspicious access patterns
- **Process Namespace Isolation**: Creates isolation boundaries using Linux namespaces
- **Cgroup Resource Control**: Enforces resource limits through control groups
- **Capability Control**: Fine-grained capability management with secure dropping and restoration

### 2. Filesystem Security

- **Inotify Monitoring**: Real-time event-based monitoring of filesystem changes
- **Hash Verification**: Cryptographic validation of binary integrity
- **Extended Attributes**: Uses file system xattrs for storing and verifying security metadata
- **Change Detection Algorithms**: Statistical and rule-based change detection for configuration files
- **File Access Control**: Monitors and restricts access to sensitive files
- **Quarantine Mechanisms**: Isolates and contains potentially compromised files

### 3. Privilege Management

- **Capability-based Access Control**: Uses Linux capabilities instead of full root privileges
- **Secure Privilege Dropping**: Permanently drops unnecessary privileges after initialization
- **Temporary Privilege Elevation**: Securely elevates privileges only when required
- **User/Group ID Manipulation**: Creates dedicated service users with minimal permissions
- **Mount Namespace Control**: Restricts visibility of sensitive filesystem paths

### 4. Performance Optimization

- **Adaptive Scanning**: Adjusts scanning frequency based on system load
- **Resource-Aware Processing**: Scales back monitoring during high system load
- **Incremental Analysis**: Focuses on changes rather than full system scans
- **Multi-Process Architecture**: Distributes monitoring load across worker processes
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents excessive resource consumption during attack conditions

### 5. Advanced Detection Techniques

- **Behavioral Baselining**: Establishes normal behavior patterns and detects deviations
- **Statistical Anomaly Detection**: Uses statistical methods to identify outliers
- **Signature-Based Detection**: Employs known patterns to identify malicious activity
- **Heuristic Analysis**: Uses rule-based detection for previously unseen threats
- **Correlation Engine**: Connects events across different monitoring tools for comprehensive threat analysis
